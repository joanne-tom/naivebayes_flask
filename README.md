# 🧠 Naive Bayes Classifier Web App

This is a Flask-based web application that implements a Naive Bayes classification model using the **Social_Network_Ads.csv** dataset. It predicts whether a user will purchase a product based on features such as **Age**, **Gender**, and **Estimated Salary**. This project was created as part of my learning journey in Flask and Bootstrap.  

## 🔍 Features

- 📊 Trained Naive Bayes classifier on social network ad data
- 🧪 Input form to test predictions on user-entered data
- 📈 Model evaluation with accuracy and classification report
- 🌐 Clean and responsive UI styled with **Bootstrap**
- 🎨 Background visuals and styling enhancements(minimal)

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset used is `Social_Network_Ads.csv`, of which chosen are:
- Age
- Gender
- Estimated Salary
